# TheGreenTeaMachine
Arduino powered GreenTeaMachine.

## Motivation
Japanese greentea needs special temperatures for best taste.

## How does this work
The TheGreenTeaMachine monitors the temperature of the water and buzzers when the selected temperature is given.
Three target temperatures (70, 80, 90) can be selected via button press.
The monitoring starts automagically when the target temperature threshold is reached.



This is the first working prototype of TheGreenTeaMachine :-)

- **TheGreenTeaMachine.fzz** is the **Fritzing** file of the hardware.
- **TheGreenTeaMachine.ino** is the **Arduino** sketch with the software
