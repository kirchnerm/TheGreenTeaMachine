# TheGreenTeaMachine
Arduino powered GreenTeaMachine.

# Motivation
Japanese greentea needs special temperatures for best taste.
The greentea machine monitors the temperature of the water and buzzers when the selected temperature is given.
Three target temperatures (70,80,90) can be selected via button press.

This is the first working prototype of TheGreenTeaMachine :-)
